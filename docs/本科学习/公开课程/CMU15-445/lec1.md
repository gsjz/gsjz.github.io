### flat file strawman

pure text, simple-structured

Why 'flat'? The first meaning came up to me, is the â™­ in music sheet.
Here means not-peaked, boring.

Literally, straw-man. It metaphorically refers to a simplified idea.

CSV: comma-separated value. 
Use a separate file per entity.
The application must parse the files each time they want to read or update records.

Of course there're a lot of issues.

### database management system

abbreviation: DBMS

### data model

rules that define the types of things could exist and how they relate.

Schema defines the structure of database for a data model. 
Otherwise, they are random bits with no meaning.

- Relational (Most)
- Key / Value (Simple Apps / Caching)
- Graph, Document / JSON / XML / Object, Wide-Column / Column-family  (NoSQL)
- Array (Vector, Matrix, Tensor) (ML/Science)
- Hierarchical, Network, Semantic, Entity-Relationship (Obsolete / Legacy / Rare)

NoSQL means schema-less, flexible... BUT it has no strict definition.
