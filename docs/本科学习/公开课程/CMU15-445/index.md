I choose this as my first online lesson, in my third term undergraduate. This term I will have four major courses in my school:

- Data Bases
- Image Processing
- Software Engineering
- Low-level Programming

Since the courses in past one year is not that well-qualified, I decide to learn courses online in more topped school myself, correspondingly.

I also want to integrate my English learning into this process. They are less important, so will be attached at the end of each notes.
