    Assume that $f(x)$ satisfies $f''(x) + [f'(x)]^2 = x$ and $f'(0) = 0$ Then ()

    (A) $f(0)$ is the local maximum value $f(x)$,  

    (B) $f(0)$ is the local minimum value $f(x)$,  

    (C) $(0, f(0))$ is the inflection point of the curve $y = f(x)$,  

    (D) not only $f(0)$ is not an extreme value of $f(x)$, but also $(0, f(0))$ is not the inflection point of the curve $y = f(x)$.


It's similar to the following link:
[Solve the differential equation $y'=y^2-x$ - Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2648835/solve-the-differential-equation-y-y2-x)

According to the Mathematica, the $f'$ seems to be non-negative at all. $f''<0$ at the $0^-$, $f''>0$ at the $0^+$. So it tends to be C.
