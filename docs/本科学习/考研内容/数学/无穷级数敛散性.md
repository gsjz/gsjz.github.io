## a MAP for con-divergence number series

Here is a MAP for the classical number series with the form

$$
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} a_n
$$

Below we will only list the $a_n$. It's easy to get that, convergence means $a_n$ is small enough, vice versa.
### convergence


$$
\tag{1} \frac{1}{n^{1+\epsilon}}
$$
here $\epsilon$ represents a fixed positive number. Integration estimation.

---

$$
\tag{2} \frac{1}{3^{\sqrt{n}}}
$$
Dividing into group, with respect to power numbers.

---

$$
\tag{3} \frac{1}{n^{2n\sin\frac{1}{n}}}
$$

Link to $(1)$ by comparision test.

---

$$
\tag{4} \frac{1}{n}-\ln(1+\frac{1}{n})
$$

This instance is kind of tricky. Because the sum of $\ln(\frac{1+n}{n})$ is gonna be $\ln(1+N)$. So this instance actually leads to the Euler constant $\gamma$.

### divergence

$$
\tag{1} \frac{1}{n}
$$

classical.

---

$$
\tag{2} \frac{1}{n^{1+\frac{1}{n}}}
$$


Link to $(1)$ by comparision test.

---

$$
\tag{3} \frac{1}{n\ln(n)}
$$

Integration estimation.

To be continued...
