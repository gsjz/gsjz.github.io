## 1.

Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be a non-singular matrix. Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be column vectors.
Define the rank 1 perturbation $\tilde{A} = A + uv^T$.

### (a)

Derive a necessary and sufficient condition for $\tilde{A}$ to be invertible.

### (b)

Let $x, z, b$ be column vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Suppose one can solve $Az = b$ with $O(n)$ flops.
Under the conditions derived in (a), design an algorithm to solve $\tilde{A}x = b$ with $O(n)$ flops, and provide justification for your answer.

## 2.

Consider the integral
$$
\int_0^\infty f(x),dx
$$
where $f$ is continuous, $f'(0)\neq 0$, and $f(x)$ decays like $x^{-1-\alpha}$ with $\alpha>0$ as $x\to\infty$.

### (a)

Suppose you apply the equispaced composite trapezoid rule with $n$ subintervals to approximate
$$
\int_0^L f(x),dx.
$$
What is the asymptotic error formula as $n\to\infty$ with $L$ fixed?

### (b)

Regard the quadrature in (a) as an approximation to the full integral on $(0,\infty)$.
How should $L$ increase with $n$ to optimize the asymptotic rate of total error decay?
What is the resulting error decay rate?

### (c)

Make the change of variable
$$
x = L\frac{1+y}{1-y},\qquad y = \frac{x-L}{x+L},
$$
to obtain
$$
\int_{-1}^1 F_L(y),dy.
$$
Apply the equispaced composite trapezoid rule; what is the asymptotic error formula for fixed $L$?

### (d)

Depending on $\alpha$, which method—domain truncation or change-of-variable—is preferable?

## 3.

Consider the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind
$$
T_n(x)=\cos(n\theta),\qquad x=\cos\theta,; x\in[-1,1].
$$

The Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind are defined as
$$
U_n(x) = \frac{1}{n+1}T_n'(x),\qquad n\ge 0.
$$

### (a)

Derive a recursive formula for computing $U_n(x)$ for all $n\ge 0$.

### (b)

Show that the Chebyshev polynomials $U_n(x)$ are orthogonal with respect to the inner product
$$
\langle f, g\rangle = \int_{-1}^1 f(x)g(x)\sqrt{1-x^2},dx.
$$

### (c)

Derive the 2-point Gaussian Quadrature rule for the integral
$$
\int_{-1}^1 f(x)\sqrt{1-x^2},dx = \sum_{j=1}^2 w_j f(x_j).
$$

## 4.

Consider the boundary value problem
$$
-\frac{d}{dx}\left(a(x)\frac{du}{dx}\right) = f(x),\qquad u(0)=u(1)=0
$$
where $a(x)>\delta\ge 0$ is a bounded differentiable function in $[0,1]$, and although $a(x)$ is available, an expression for its derivative $a'(x)$ is not available.

### (a)

Using finite differences and an equally spaced grid in $[0,1]$,
$x_l = hl,; l=0,\dots,n$, $h=1/n$, discretize the ODE to obtain a linear system giving an $O(h^2)$ approximation.
After applying boundary conditions, the resulting coefficient matrix is an $(n-1)\times(n-1)$ tridiagonal matrix.
Provide a derivation and give the expressions of its entries.

### (b)

Using all provided information, find a disk in $\mathbb{C}$—the smaller the better—that is guaranteed to contain all eigenvalues of the linear system in part (a).

## 5.

### (a)

Verify that the PDE
$$
u_t = u_{xxx}
$$
is well posed as an initial value problem.

### (b)

Consider solving it numerically using the scheme
$$
\frac{u(t+k,x) - u(t-k,x)}{2k}
=
\frac{-\tfrac12 u(x-2h,t) + u(x-h,t) - u(x+h,t) + \tfrac12 u(x+2h,t)}{h}.
$$
Determine this scheme’s stability condition.

## 6.

Consider the diffusion equation
$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = \mu \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2},\qquad v(x,0)=\varphi(x),
$$
with periodic boundary conditions and
$$
\int_a^b v(x,t),dx = 0.
$$

Let $[a,b]=[0,2\pi]$, lattice points $0,h,2h,\dots,(N-1)h$, $h=\frac{2\pi}{N}$ with even $N$.

The central difference operator for the Laplacian:
$$
L v_m = \frac{v_{m+1}-2v_m+v_{m-1}}{h^2}.
$$

Two finite difference approximations:

1. Forward–Euler
   $$
   v^{n+1} = v^n + \mu k L v^n.
   $$

2. Crank–Nicolson
   $$
   v^{n+1} = v^n + \mu k (L v^n + L v^{n+1}).
   $$

### (a)

Determine the order of accuracy of $L v$ in approximating $v_{xx}$.

### (b)

Using
$$
v_m^n = \sum_{l=0}^{N-1} \hat{v}_l^n \exp\left(-i\frac{2\pi lm}{N}\right),
$$
give the updates $\hat{v}_l^{n+1}$ in terms of $\hat{v}_l^n$ for each method, including $l=0$.

### (c)

Give the solution $v_m^n$ for each method when the initial condition is
$$
\varphi(m\Delta x) = (-1)^m.
$$

### (d)

What are the stability constraints on the time step $k$ for each method, if any?
Express them in the form $k \le F(h,\mu)$.
